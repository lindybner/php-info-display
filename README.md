# PHP Info Display

A simple PHP script to display PHP version and configuration information using the `phpinfo()` function.

## Description

This exercise consists of a basic PHP script embedded in an HTML file that leverages the `phpinfo()` function to retrieve and display detailed PHP configuration information. The script is designed to be accessed through a web browser, providing a quick and easy way to inspect the PHP environment.

## File Structure

- **index.php:** The main HTML file containing the PHP script with the `phpinfo()` function call.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP:** Used to dynamically generate and display PHP configuration information.
- **HTML:** Used to structure the web page and embed the PHP script.

## Caution

Exercise caution when using `phpinfo()` on a live server, especially in a production environment. The function reveals sensitive information about the server's PHP configuration. Limit its use to controlled and secure development or debugging environments.
